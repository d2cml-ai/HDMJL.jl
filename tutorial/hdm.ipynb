        "Analysis of high-dimensional models, models in which the number of parameters to be estimated is large relative to the sample size, is becoming increasingly important. Such models arise naturally in modern data sets which have many measured characteristics available per individual observation as in, for example, population census data, scanner data, and text data. Such models also arise naturally even in data with a small number of measured characteristics in situations where the exact functional form with which the observed variables enter the model is unknown and we create many technical variables, a dictionary, from the raw characteristics. Examples covered by this scenario include semi-parametric models with non-parametric nuisance functions. More generally, models with many parameters relative to the sample size often arise when attempting to model complex phenomena. With increasing availability of such data sets in economics and other data science fields, new methods for analyzing those data have been developed. The `Julia` package `HDMjl` contains implementations of recently developed methods for high-dimensional approximately sparse models, mainly relying on forms of lasso and post-lasso as well as related estimation and inference methods. The methods are illustrated with econometric applications, but are also useful in other disciplines such as medicine, biology, sociology or psychology.\n",
        "\n",
        "The methods which are implemented in this package are distinct from already available methods in other packages in the following four major ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. First, we provide a version of Lasso regression that expressly handles and allows for non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic errors.\n",
        "2. Second, we implement a theoretically grounded, data-driven choice of the penalty level $\\lambda$ in the Lasso regressions. To underscore this choice, we call the Lasso implementation in this package \"rigorous\"Lasso (=`rlasso`). The prefix $\\mathbf{r}$ in function names should underscore this. In high dimensional settings cross-validation is very popular; but it lacks a theoretical justification for use in the present context and some theoretical proposals for the choice of $\\lambda$ are often not feasible. Moreover, the theoretically grounded, data-driven choice redundancies cross-validation which is time-consuming particularly in large data sets.\n",
        "3. Third, we provide efficient estimators and uniformly valid confidence intervals for various low-dimensional causal/structural parameters appearing in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. For example, we provide efficient estimators and uniformly valid confidence intervals for a regression coefficient on a target variable (e.g., a treatment or policy variable) in a high-dimensional sparse regression model. Target variable in this context means the object not interest, e.g. a pre-specified regression coefficient. We also provide estimates and confidence intervals for average treatment effect (ATE) and average treatment effect for the treated (ATET), as well extensions of these parameters to the endogenous setting.\n",
        "4. Fourth, joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals for estimated coefficients in a high-dimensional approximately sparse models are provided, based on the methods and theory developed in Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Kato (2014). They proposed uniformly valid confidence regions for regressions coefficients in a high-dimensional sparse Z-estimation problems, which include median, mean, and many other regression problems as special cases. In this article we apply this method to the coefficients of a Lasso regression and highlight this method with an empirical example.\n",

To help overcome this simultaneity, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001) use mortality rates for early European settlers as an instrument for institution quality. The validity of this instrument hinges on the argument that settlers set up better institutions in places where they are more likely to establish long-term settlements, that where they are likely to settle for the long term is related to settler mortality at the time of initial colonization, and that institutions are highly persistent. The exclusion restriction for the instrumental variable is then motivated by the argument that GDP, while persistent, is unlikely to be strongly influenced by mortality in the previous century, or earlier, except through institutions.\n",

This case is more complicated than the additive case, which is covered as a special case of Section 3. However, the same underlying principle ' the orthogonality principle ' applies for the estimation and inference on the treatment effect parameters. Estimation and inference of treatment effects in a high-dimensional setting is analysed in Belloni, Chernozhukov, Fern´andez-Val, and Hansen (2013).\n",

Examples are the effectiveness of a job related training program or the effect of a newly developed drug. We consider n units or individuals, $i = 1,\\dots, n$. For each individual we observe the treatment status. The treatment variable $D_i$ takes the value 1, if the unit received (active) treatment, and 0, if it received the control treatment. For each individual we observe the outcome for only one of the two potential treatment states. Hence, the observed outcome depends on the treatment status and is denoted by $Y_i(D_i)$. One important parameter of interest is the average treatment effect (ATE):\n",

        "When trying to estimate treatment effects, the researcher has to decide what conditioning variables to include. In the case of a non-randomly assigned treatment or instrumental variable, the researcher must select the conditioning variables so that the instrument or treatment is plausibly exogenous. Even in the case of random assignment, for a precise estimation of the policy variable selection of control variables is necessary to absorb residual variation, but overfitting should be avoided. For uniformly valid post-selection inference, “orthogonal ”estimating equations as described above are they key to the efficient estimation and valid inference.

For the calculation of the standard errors bootstrap methods are implemented, with options to use Bayes, normal, or wild bootstrap. The number of repetitions can be specified with the argument nRep and the default is set to 500. By default no bootstrap standard errors are provided (bootstrap=\"none\"). For the functions the logicals intercept and post can be specified to include an intercept and to do Post-Lasso at the selection steps.

        "Though it is clear that 401(k) plans are widely used as vehicles for retirement saving, their effect on assets is less clear. The key problem in determining the effect of participation in 401(k) plans on accumulated assets is saver heterogeneity coupled with nonrandom selection into participation states. In particular, it is generally recognized that some people have a higher preference for saving than others. Thus, it seems likely that those individuals with the highest unobserved preference for saving would be most likely to choose to participate in tax-advantaged retirement savings plans and would also have higher savings in other assets than individuals with lower unobserved saving propensity. This implies that conventional estimates that do not allow for saver heterogeneity and selection of the participation state will be biased upward, tending to overstate the actual savings effects of 401(k) and IRA participation.\n",
